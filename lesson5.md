How signals physically travel.

**Key Concepts:**
- Wired: Twisted pair, Coaxial cable, Fiber optics (Single-mode vs multi-mode, Attenuation, Dispersion, Optical amplifiers)
- Wireless & RF: Antennas (types, gain, radiation pattern), Propagation models, Path loss, Fading (Rayleigh, Rician), Doppler effect

**Why It Matters:** Bridges theory with real-world physics in telecom infrastructure.

**Labs/Practice:** Tested fiber optic attenuation; modeled wireless propagation in simulations.

**Tools Used:** Omnet++, NS3, Cisco Packet Tracer.
