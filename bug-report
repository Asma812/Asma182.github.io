- **Description**
- **Steps to reproduce**
- **Impact**
- **Why it matters**

## ✅ CONFIRMED VULNERABILITIES (REPORT-READY)

### 1. JWT alg=none Authentication Bypass
**Severity:** Critical  
**Category:** Authentication Bypass / Cryptography  
**Component:** JWT Authentication  
**Affected Endpoints:** All authenticated API endpoints using JWT  

**Description**  
The application accepts unsigned JWT tokens by allowing the `alg` header value to be set to `none`. This allows attackers to forge arbitrary tokens without knowing the private signing key.

**Steps to Reproduce**  
1. Login normally and obtain a valid JWT.  
2. Decode the JWT header and payload.  
3. Modify the header:  
   ```json
   {
     "alg": "none",
     "typ": "JWT"
   }
